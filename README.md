# Free space Local Local Oscillator Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution
In today's highly developed information society, ensuring the security of information transmission is of great importance to all fields. Quantum key distribution protocol (QKD) has attracted wide attention due to its theoretical security, and continuous variable QKD based on coherent states has the advantages of high theoretical security bit rate, low actual detection cost, and easy integration, so it has become one of the important research directions in the field of quantum key distribution.
